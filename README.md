This is the source code for Snack Wanderer, our entry for the GET LARGE Jam in August of 2025. I removed the butt pose sprites since, according to the artist, they were traced from AI output. Otherwise, everything is intact.

The version of GameMaker Studio 2 I currently have is IDE v2024.13.1.193, and runtime v2024.13.1.242. I have not updated it or used GameMaker pretty much at all since v1.0.7.1 of Snack Wanderer was released, so I believe it should entirely work on that version. No idea if that's useful information, so take that as you will.
