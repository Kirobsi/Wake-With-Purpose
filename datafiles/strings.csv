0,"After a moment to sit up, you look over yourself.",,,,,,,,,,
0,"Your enormous belly heaves out significantly in front of you, spilling over most of your lap. It's topped with breasts that might inspire jealousy in skinny folk if the rest of your fat were out of sight.",,,,,,,,,,
0,"Hoof-tipped arms droop halfway down your torso while holding them straight, though you rarely ever do that. They're profoundly soft and wobbly, a point of pride for your figure.",,,,,,,,,,
