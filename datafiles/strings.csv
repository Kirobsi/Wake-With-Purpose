0,"You wake slowly, the ambience of the sea coming into focus. You feel somewhat sore all over, although it gradually fades.",,,,,,,,
0,"Sand covers much of your front, unpleasant grit embedding itself into your skin.",,,,,,,,
0,"After a moment to sit up, you look over yourself.",,,,,,,,
0,"Your enormous belly heaves out significantly in front of you, spilling over most of your lap, and topped with breasts that might inspire jealousy in skinny folk if the rest of your fat were out of sight.",,,,,,,,
0,"Hoof-tipped arms droop halfway down your torso while holding them straight, though you rarely ever do that. They're profoundly soft and wobbly, a point of pride for your figure.",,,,,,,,
0,"Your legs are dimpled, doughy columns that jiggle profusely with most movement, more than wide enough to force a waddle.",,,,,,,,
0,"In other words, all seems normal about you.",,,,,,,,
0,"A beat after your self-examination, you hear something breach the surface of the water behind you, and turn to face it.",,,,,,,,
Die,,,,,,,,,
0,"A somewhat fat, feminine shark walks up to you. You arduously stand up.",,,,,,,,
3,Are you okay?,,,,,,,,
3,"I thought I heard something up here, but it's hard to tell underwater. Glad I checked.",,,,,,,,
0,"She wears a friendly grin tinged with concern. Her voice is deep, smooth. It's soothing.",,,,,,,,
1,I seem to be alright...,,,,,,,,
1,Who are you?,,,,,,,,
2,"I'm Siblif. I live underwater, not far from this island.",,,,,,,,
2,"I was just out for a swim, actually! I don't think I'd have heard anything if I was back home.",,,,,,,,
2,"Anyway- what's your name, tubby?",,,,,,,,
0,Your face gets a little warm at that.,,,,,,,,
1,My name is Kiwi. I don't know how I ended up here.,,,,,,,,
2,"Good to meet you, then. You look nice and heavy!",,,,,,,,
0,"Siblif briefly glances around, then back to you. Her smile looks a bit more artificial; she speaks with a chuckle.",,,,,,,,
2,...How good are you at swimming?,,,,,,,,
0,You stare blankly at her.,,,,,,,,
0,"She returns your gaze, faltering smile betraying amused pity.",,,,,,,,
2,Thought so.,,,,,,,,
2,"Well, look, I'll cut you a deal: I worked up an appetite on my travels and I'm feeling pretty tired, so I'm gonna stay here.",,,,,,,,
2,"My friends tell me the fruits and vegetables that grow here are great, but I've never gotten around to trying it. How about you go find us some food while I set up a place to stay for tonight?",,,,,,,,
2,Then tomorrow - or maybe a little longer if it tastes really good - I can help you get back to wherever you live. Sound good?,What?,60,I guess so...?,58,Sure!,56,,
0,"She's positively beaming, transparently mischievous.",,,,,,,,
2,"Alright, sounds great! Glad you're on board.",,,,,,,,
2,"There are a few different biomes around here, each with different plants. I'm happy to eat any of them, so you take your pick and head off when you're ready.",,,,,,,,
2,"There's a cave nearby, apparently plant life flourishes down there. Bit dangerous, though.",,,,,,,,
2,"The jungle speaks for itself. I hear it can be hard to find some of the plants, but I'm sure you can manage.",,,,,,,,
2,"Finally, there are some delicate ingredients up on the mountain. That might take more stamina than you can offer, but you're welcome to try.",,,,,,,,

0,"A lit oil lamp sits on a tiny table, emitting a stark orange glow across the decidedly opaque tent fabric. It's a warm, inviting light.",,,,,,,,
0,"Below, two camping mats lay parallel just a few decimeters apart, thankfully both very wide. They look comfy enough, and are headed by big, fluffy pillows.",,,,,,,,
0,Elsewhere on the ground you even spot some shallow bowls & eating utensils atop a few cloths! Quite fully featured.,,,,,,,,

1,"Well, I got a couple things...",,,,,,,,
0,You show the poor shark your pitiful haul. She frowns at it.,,,,,,,,
2,"I doubt that could feed a starving kid, Kiwi. Did you eat most of the food yourself?",,,,,,,,
2,"Whatever. Cook what you can first, then come back to me. I don't want to eat raw ingredients.",,,,,,,,
goto,95,,,,,,,,
2,"But, you have to cook it first! I don't want raw ingredients.",,,,,,,,
1,Right...,,,,,,,,
1,"I guess you're pretty tired after setting all this up, then.",,,,,,,,
0,"You're exhausted yourself, but whatever - you're a people-pleaser, so you silently comply with her questionable demand.",,,,,,,,
1,"Good job, by the way! I didn't know what to expect, but this is a lot.",,,,,,,,
2,"Oh, thank you. It was hard work, and now I'm starving. My meal can be your 'thanks'.",,,,,,,,
0,"In spite of the somewhat dismissive response, her expression conveys sincere gratitude.",,,,,,,,
0,"You pick up the bowls and utensils and leave the tent, ready to cook food for the evening.",,,,,,,,
Die,localState++,obj_BeachHandler,,,,,,,

2,"Smells great! Worth the wait, eh?",,,,,,,,
0,"You give a short, bewildered chuckle.",,,,,,,,
1,Are you sure you even smelled it yet?,,,,,,,,
2,"Oh, of course I have. Whatever - it'll be great! My friends love this stuff.",,,,,,,,
2,We will too.,,,,,,,,
0,"At that, she dons a gentle, earnest smile.",,,,,,,,

Die,localState++,obj_BeachHandler,,,,,,,

1,...Woah. I didn't think I made enough food to do that.,,,,,,,,
2,"Yeah, me neither!",,,,,,,,
2,I just woke up and noticed my belly was softer! And spills out further! Weird!,,,,,,,,
2,It's also... extra rumbly.,,,,,,,,
2,Or maybe I'm just that hungry~,,,,,,,,
2,"Anyway, that's about as much as I usually eat, so I dunno what happened!",,,,,,,,
1,"That was pretty average for me too, now that you mention it.",,,,,,,,
1,"Although, I'm a lot fatter than you are.",,,,,,,,
2,Don't brag...,,,,,,,,
2,"You know, maybe we should try some more food here? To see if it's a fluke or not.",,,,,,,,
1,Uh... I guess?,,,,,,,,
1,Getting home probably isn't urgent. Not that I remember either way.,,,,,,,,
2,"Great! Well I'm just starving by now - you've been asleep forever, by the way - so I'm in no shape to gather food.",,,,,,,,
2,"Plus, burning so many calories would compromise the results!",,,,,,,,
2,"That's why you haven't gained anything, obviously.",,,,,,,,
1,"I don't think the same amount of weight is as noticeable on me, Siblif, I very well could have gained the same amount.",,,,,,,,
2,"Well, you can't really test two factors at once like that, so we can't know which of those is the true culprit.",,,,,,,,
2,"But with me, we're only testing one! Simple.",,,,,,,,
0,She seems eager to gain weight! That's exciting...,,,,,,,,
0,"You're only so fat due to a similar enthusiasm, so you're all too happy to see someone else plump up.",,,,,,,,
0,"Especially helping the person in question, using food that's unnaturally fattening- if that's what this truly was.",,,,,,,,
0,"And judging by her weird excuses and manic energy... maybe she's just as, if not more, into weight gain as you are.",,,,,,,,
1,"...Okay. Sure, I'll get some more food.",,,,,,,,
0,She's visibly delighted by that.,,,,,,,,
0,"...Yeah, there's no way she's normal about gaining weight.",,,,,,,,
0,That's a topic you'll need to broach later.,,,,,,,,
