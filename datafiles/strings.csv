0,"You wake slowly, the ambience of the sea coming into focus. You feel somewhat sore all over, although it's gradually fading.",,,,,,,,
0,"Sand covers much of your front, unpleasant grit embedding itself into your skin.",,,,,,,,
0,"After a moment to sit up, you look over yourself.",,,,,,,,
0,"Your enormous belly heaves out significantly in front of you, spilling over most of your lap, and topped with breasts that might inspire jealousy in skinny folk if the rest of your fat were out of sight.",,,,,,,,
0,"Hoof-tipped arms droop halfway down your torso while holding them straight, though you rarely ever do that. They're profoundly soft and wobbly, a point of pride for your figure.",,,,,,,,
0,"Your legs are dimpled, doughy columns that jiggle profusely with most movement, more than wide enough to force a waddle.",,,,,,,,
0,"In other words, all seems normal about you.",,,,,,,,
0,"A beat after your self-examination, you hear something breach the surface of the water behind you, and turn to face it.",,,,,,,,

0,"A chubby, feminine shark walks up to you. You stand up.",,,,,,,,
3,Are you okay?,,,,,,,,
3,"I thought I heard something up here, but it's hard to tell underwater. Glad I checked.",,,,,,,,
0,She wears a friendly grin tinged with concern.,,,,,,,,
1,I seem to be alright...,,,,,,,,
1,Who are you?,,,,,,,,
2,"I'm Siblif. I live underwater, not far from this island.",,,,,,,,
2,"I was just out for a swim, actually! I don't think I'd have heard anything if I was back home.",,,,,,,,
2,"Anyway- what's your name, tubby?",,,,,,,,
0,Your face gets a little warm at that.,,,,,,,,
1,My name is Kiwi. I'm not sure how I ended up here.,,,,,,,,
2,"Nice to meet you, then. You look nice!",,,,,,,,
0,"Siblif briefly glances around, then back to you. Her smile looks a bit more artificial; she speaks with a chuckle.",,,,,,,,
2,...How good are you at swimming?,,,,,,,,
0,You stare blankly at her.,,,,,,,,
0,"She returns your gaze, faltering smile filled with amused pity.",,,,,,,,
2,Thought so.,,,,,,,,
2,"Well, look, I'll cut you a deal: I worked up an appetite on my swim, and I'm feeling pretty tired, so I'm gonna stay here.",,,,,,,,
2,"My friends tell me the fruits and vegetables that grow here are great, but I've never gotten around to trying it. How about you go find us some food while I set up a place to stay for tonight?",,,,,,,,
2,Then tomorrow - or maybe a little longer if it tastes really good - I can help you get back to wherever you live. Sound good?,What?,60,I guess so...?,58,Sure!,56,,
0,"She's positively beaming, transparently mischievous.",,,,,,,,
2,"Alright, sounds great! Glad you're on board.",,,,,,,,
2,"There are a few different biomes around here, each with different plants. I'm happy to eat any of them, so you take your pick and head off when you're ready.",,,,,,,,
2,"There's a cave nearby, apparently plant life flourishes down there. Bit dangerous, though.",,,,,,,,
2,"The jungle speaks for itself. I hear it can be hard to find some of the plants, but I'm sure you can manage.",,,,,,,,
2,"Finally, there are some delicate ingredients up on the mountain. That might take more stamina than you can offer, but you're welcome to try.",,,,,,,,
